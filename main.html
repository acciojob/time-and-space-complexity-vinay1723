	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the growth of an algorithm's runtime relative to input size, while efficient evaluates its optimality in terms of speed and resource usage.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>,O(n) represents the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size n, including both auxiliary and input storage.</p>
